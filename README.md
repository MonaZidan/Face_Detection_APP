# Face_Detection_APP
 This project is a Face Detection Application built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Streamlit. It allows users to upload an image and detect faces using two different methods: OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier and Google's MediaPipe Face Detection. The application provides a user-friendly interface to compare the results of both methods side by side.
